# Title

*Explore The Art World with RESTful APIs*

## Role(s)

- *student*

## Level

- *beginner*

## Product(s)

- *Visual Studio Code*

## Prerequisites

- *Development Environment with VS Code Installed*
- *Internet connectivity*

## Summary

*In this module, you will learn about APIs, the "Application Programming Interfaces" that act like the 'handshake' between a web site's frontend and backend, with specific focus on RESTful APIs. You will first create a simple local API with a .json file and then work with APIs from the the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Cooper Hewitt Museum to learn about the ways to securely interact with third-party interfaces.*

## Learning objectives

1. REpresentational State Transfer - a REST primer
2. Learn about the ways to connect to a RESTful API
3. Build a basic API locally
4. Authentication strategies
5. Query your first API to search for objects at the Victoria and Albert
6. Work with tokens and query parameters to find an unusual design object at the Cooper Hewitt Museum
7. Handle responses, including errors by understanding HTTP codes
8. Using libraries to help with your queries (axios)
9. Other types of APIs you might encounter (The Met's CSV strategy)
