# Title

*Explore the Earth with RESTful APIs *

## Role(s)

- *student*

## Level

- *beginner*

## Product(s)

- *Visual Studio Code*

## Prerequisites

- *Development Environment with VS Code Installed*
- *Internet connectivity*

## Summary

*In this module, you will learn about APIs, the "Application Programming Interfaces" that act like the 'handshake' between a web site's frontend and backend, with specific focus on RESTful APIs. You will first create a simple local API with a .json file and then work with several of NASA's APIs to learn about the ways to securely interact with third-party interfaces.*

## Learning objectives

1. REpresentational State Transfer - a REST primer
2. Learn about the ways to connect to a RESTful API
3. Build a basic API locally
4. Authentication strategies
5. Query your first API to get an image of the earth from NASA
6. Work with query parameters to see if a meteor is approaching the Earth
7. Handle responses, including errors by understanding HTTP codew
8. Using libraries to help with your queries (axios)
8. Other types of APIs you might encounter

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |
